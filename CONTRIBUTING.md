# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for taking your time contributing 🎉🙏.

If you have issues, questions, or suggestions, simply open an issue. If you know how to fix such issues, consider forking and opening a pull request. If you wish to fix existing issues, please tell us you're about to work on it on the issue page before forking.

I'll address these as soon as possible, you're my priority because you're awesome enough to contribute 😎.

When opening a pull request, please make sure it follows the following conventions:

- There's no spelling nor grammatical errors
- Rust codes are formatted with [Rustfmt], [Cargo] comes with it and you can use the command `cargo fmt`
- Markdown files are linted with [DavidAnson/markdownlint]

[Rustfmt]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt
[Cargo]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo
[DavidAnson/markdownlint]: https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint

Don't sweat this much though, sometimes the owner himself forget these 😅, you may instead allow me to modify your code before merging it so it comply with the conventions 🧐✏.
