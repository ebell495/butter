# Boolean

Boolean in butter!

```butter
foo = true;
```

## Logical operators

- And `A && B`
- Or `A || B`
- Not `!A`
- Nxor `A == B`
- Xor `A != B`

"And" and "or" operators have short-circuiting behavior. When the left hand side of "and" operator is false, it immediately evaluates to false without evaluating the right hand side. Same for "or" operator with left hand side being true.
