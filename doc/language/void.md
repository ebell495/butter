# Void

`void` represents nothing. It is used as placeholder for values when there's no useful value in there.

Most of the time, you won't explicitly type it. It is an implicit value for blocks that doesn't end in an expression: it will implicitly end with an expression `void`, tags without associated value: the value will implicitly be `void`.
