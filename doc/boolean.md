# Boolean

Boolean in butter!

```butter
foo = true;
```

## Logical operators

- And `A && B`
- Or `A || B`
- Not `!A`

"And" and "or" operators have short-circuiting behavior. When the left hand side of "and" operator is false, it immediately evaluates to false without evaluation the right hand side.
