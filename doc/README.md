# Butter docs

Butter is still in development. Some of the documentation could be outdated, some could be incomplete.

## Language

A high level documentation of various operation in Butter. It describes its syntaxes through examples.

## Type and Semantics

While language describes its syntaxes, this section describes its semantics. Butter have rich semantics, most of those are inferred and can't be describe by its syntax alone, so this section would be helpful as well.

## Low level representation

Describes how Butter's high-level value roughly represents low-level values. Roughly means if Butter does naive compilation, as it can have more optimization from LLVM (hopefully).
