# Butter docs

## [Plan](./plan.md)

Butter is still in development!

## Language

A high level documentation of various operation in Butter. It describes its syntaxes through examples.

- [Array](language/array.md)
- [Boolean](language/boolean.md)
- [Clone](language/clone.md)
- [Comment](language/comment.md)
- [Control flow](language/control_flow.md)
- [Function](language/function.md)
- [Group](language/group.md)
- [Null and optional](language/null_and_optional.md)
- [Number](language/number.md)
- [Miscellaneous](language/miscellaneous.md)
- [Reference](language/reference.md)
- [String and char](language/string_and_char.md)
- [Struct](language/struct.md)
- [Unpacking](language/unpacking.md)
- [Variable and assignment](language/variable_and_assignment.md)

## Type and Semantics

While language describes its syntaxes, this section describes its semantics. Butter have rich semantics, most of those are inferred and can't be describe by its syntax alone, so this section would be helpful as well.

This section is still empty

## Standard library

TODO

## [Ideas](idea.md)

I'm too excited. While keeping the language simple, here is some ideas that seems useful and could be added to the language, but it probably needs a polish first.
