# ðŸ§ˆ Butter

[![Rust](https://github.com/neverRare/butter/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)](https://github.com/neverRare/butter/actions?query=workflow%3ARust)

A small and simple programming language just for fun. Butter is designed to have simple data types as C and Go, memory safety as Rust, and type inference as TypeScript and Crystal.

```butter
std::print("hello world\n");
```

This is my personal project for learning compilers. If you know programming (of course you do!) you'll notice how this language severely lacks features (it needs bread, haha, get it?).

Very much wip btw.
